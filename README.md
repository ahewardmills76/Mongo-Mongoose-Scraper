# Mongo-Mongoose-Scraper

This Mongo Mongoose scraper is still in development.  Upon opening it up in the browser,
you click the "scrape articles" button, and it will scrape the nytimes website for articles
and render each article with a div.  There are some styling issues and the functionality 
to save articles and notes is not currently operable.
